<p>With all due repect, what the fuck?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our penetration team has been going over the security you put up for Money Corp and it is, quite frankly, abysmal.</p>
<p>Case and point, a copy of your entire user database is accessible in an open directory on your site (it's under /backups).</p>
<p>A database which, I might add, contains all your passwords in plain text!</p>
<p>I can't say you're exactly alone in this regard but it needs to be rectified, immediatly.</p>
<p>I've already triggered the procedure to force all users to change their password when they log in but you still need to delete the backup from the site and change your bloody security architecture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>The team at Penetration Testers R Us</p>
